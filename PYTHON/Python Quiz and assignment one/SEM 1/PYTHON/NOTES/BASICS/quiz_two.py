#1. Write a program that takes two numbers  as  inputs and dispays thier sum their difference, thier  product and thier quotient.
#2. Write a program that compares two integers and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than  or equaal to the second number.
 #3. Write a program that checks if a given number is between 10 and 20 (20 is inclusive using logical operators.) 
#4. Write a program that prints the squeres of all integres from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
