#DATA TYPES:

# 1. Integers:(int)
#Posiive integers

 # With intgers you can do alot of operations forexample addition, sbtraction, division and etc.



#Arithematic operations that can be done with integers.
#Addition:
Mathematics = 84
Science = 80
English = 94
Result = Mathematics + Science + English

#Subtraction:
Mathematics = 89
Science = 78
Result = Mathematics - Science
