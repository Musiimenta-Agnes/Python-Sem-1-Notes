#These are used to perform mathematical operations
#1. Addition (+)
science_mark =77
math = 78
total_mark = science_mark + math # 155
print(f"my total cost is: {total_mark:,}")


#2. Subtraction(-)
science_mark = 98
math = 78
difference = science_mark - math #
print(f"The difference is:UG.Shs: {difference:,}") #The (:,) is added inorder to add a comma within the digits


#3. Multiplication(*)
computer_price = 400000
quantity = 5
result = computer_price * quantity 
print(f"The toat unit cost is UGX{result:,}")


#4. Divvision (/)
math = 96
sci = 98
phy =89
total_mark = math + sci + phy 
number_of_students = 3 
print(f"{total_mark /number_of_students:.2f}" ) # We us (:. any number you want in order to reduce or decide on 
#the number of decimal places you want to use)


#5. Floor division (//)
math = 96
sci = 98
phy =89
total_mark = math + sci + phy 
number_of_students = 3 
print(f"{total_mark//number_of_students}") # The difference between the normal division and the floor division is that
# the floor division returns an integer (This rounds off to the nearest whole number)) and the  normal division returns a float 
#(returns a number with dec. places making it a float)



#6. Modulous (%) (Remainder) This returns a remainder of something after dividing
a = 67
b = 5
result = (a % b) 
print(f"{result}")




#7. Exponential (**) This raises a number to the power of another number ie 3 power 5 = 3*3*3*3*3
# This also means a square root of a number
number = 81
square_root = number ** 0.5 # This is that number **1/2
print(f" The square root of {number} is: {square_root} ")
