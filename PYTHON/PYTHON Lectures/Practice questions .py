#4. WITI academy is proposing a sacco to help students save their money.
# Design a platform that will do the following.
# Welcome to, WITI sacco.
# 1. Deposit Money
# 2. Withdraw Money
# 3. Check Balance
# Ensure that if the students selects 1, money is depositedand the minimum deposit should be 1000.
# If the student selects 2, money should be withdrawn and a minimum withdraw is 500.
# If the sudebnts selects 3, the account balance should be displayed.
