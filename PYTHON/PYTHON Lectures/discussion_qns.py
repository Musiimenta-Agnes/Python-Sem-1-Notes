# # Basic: Write a Python program that prints all even numbers between 1 and 20 using a for loop.

# def even_numbers():
#     for num in range(2,20,2):
#         print(num)

#          if numb % 2 == 0:
#             print(f"The even numbers are : \n {numb}")
# even()

# # #Intermediate: Use a while loop to ask the user to input a number until they provide a number greater than 10.

# while True: # The while True loop runs untill the break statement is encountered.
#     number = int(input("Enter number that is greater than ten:\n"))

# # The outer loop
# print('The multiplication tabel from 1 to 5')
# for y in range(1,6):
