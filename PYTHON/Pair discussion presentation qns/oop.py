# #Basic: Create a class called Car with attributes brand and color. Instantiate an object of the Car class and print its attributes.

# #Intermediate: Add a method called start_engine to the Car class that prints a message saying the engine of the car has started. Create an instance of Car and call the method.

# # #Deposit an amount.

# # #Challenge: Implement a class called Library that manages a collection of books.

# # #Add a book to the library.
# # #Remove a book from the library.
# # #Check if a book is available by title.
# # #Borrow a book (mark it as unavailable if itâ€™s available).
# # #Return a book (mark it as available again if it was borrowed).
